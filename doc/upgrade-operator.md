# Pravega operator upgrade
When deploying the latest Pravega version, it is always advisable to first upgrade the operator to the latest version.
It has been tested that upgrading operator to minor versions, e.g. 0.4.0 -> 0.4.1, can work smoothly without interrupting
the workload. Upgrading to the major versions need to be tested further.
